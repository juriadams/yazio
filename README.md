# yazio

```bash
bun add yazio
```

## Description

`yazio` is a JavaScript/TypeScript module for interacting with the undocumented YAZIO API, which is used by their mobile apps.

This library is built using the latest web standards and can therefor also be used on various edge runtimes. This code does, of course, run on zero dependencies.

RONIN integration coming soon.

## Why

I wanted to build some personal dashboard and calendar integrations allowing me to easily track my calories and log items from the web a couple of times. I've been developing and sharing this code around from project to project and now decide to open source it after also receiving a lot of emails about their API docs.

## Develop

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To develop:

```bash
bun run dev
```
